## About
CroFiz is a web site designed for students, teachers and all those who want to learn more about physics, the world we are in and the nature that surrounds us. CroFiz allows students and teachers to connect, exchange data,learn from scripts, simulations and videos, and many other features that transform physics into the game.

## Tech

Crofiz uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* PHP - For backend purposes
* MySQL - Lots of data needs to be saved
* jQuery - Manipulating data and web content
